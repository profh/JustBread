This is a super simple PHP example for instructional purposes only.  No database connections (all the data is in arrays) and limited use of classes.  Some of this code was written for PHP 3 and PHP 4, so there might be newer built-in PHP functions to replace them, but this still serves its purpose for illustrating general PHP concepts.
